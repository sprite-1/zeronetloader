# ZeroNet Loader

A WebExtension to automatically load ZeroNet domains as well as use `z.net/` as shorthand or omnibox search keyword `zn`.


## Usage

### 1. `http://` or `https://` URLs
After installing the extension to your browser, you can now open `http://` links to ZeroNet domains like [http://blog.zeronetwork.bit](http://blog.zeronetwork.bit) and it'll automatically get redirected.

The supported domain TLDs are:

- *.bit
- *.zero
- *.zite

If you know of more, [just let me know](https://github.com/sprite-1/zeronetloader/issues).

### 2. Omnibox Keyword

In the omnibox, just type `zn` followed by a space and then the ZeroNet address you want to go to. For example, `zn 1Am2bDQhptVMxaLtKxbHCorvL1rjXtqdFH` or `zn talk.zeronetwork.bit`

### 3. Using `z.net/` Address

Same as the omnibox method but this uses the `z.net` domain to parse your path. For example, you can type `z.net/me.zeronetwork.bit` on the address bar. It also works with `z.net/1Name2NXVi1RDPDgf5617UoW7xA6YrhM9F`, etc.
